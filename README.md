# Heart-Rate-LinearFit
A simple linear fit on a middle section of HR data from an activity, useful for quantifying if I am in zone 2 or not. 
This can be easily done using the single example folder and the code that is not commented out in main.py.
The commented out cod ein main.py creates all csv file equivalents from the fit files in the fit file folder. 
It then applies linear fits to each activity and stores data about them in a pandas dataframe for further analysis.
